**How to use**<br>
1. Download both files<br>
2. Make sure you have the python modules: Flash, os, json and shutil <br>
When you want to run your code with the UNC script. Paste init.lua code **ABOVE YOUR CODE YOU WANT TO EXECUTE** <br>
Just make sure you run the python file, it just allows the filesystem to work <br>
